## FAQ:

**What is Kratscoin?**

Peer to peer (P2P) electronic money is simply described as online money sent from one person to another without the need for a trusted third-party. As described in the original Bitcoin whitepaper by Satoshi Nakamoto, P2P cash makes use of digital signatures as part of the solution, but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is still required to prevent fraud. This makes P2P cash a trustless and safe way to transact without the need of intermediaries. For more information, please refer to https://kratscoin.org/ for updates.
